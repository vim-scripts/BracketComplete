DESCRIPTION
Frequently, text inside parentheses, be it a warning "(don't do this)" or
function arguments "(foo, bar, 42)" is repeated. This also applies to other
bracket delimiters, e.g. HTML tags "<img src='banner.jpg' alt=''>" or arrays
"[1, 2, 3]".
This plugin provides a completion mapping that, when you realize you're typing
the same contents of a bracket-delimited text again, completes the entire text
inside the brackets from other matches in the buffer. The completion base
always contains the entire text between the cursor and the previous opening
bracket, so it doesn't matter how far you've already been into retyping this.

SEE ALSO
- Check out the CompleteHelper.vim plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

USAGE
In insert mode, invoke the completion via CTRL-X ).
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.

CTRL-X )                Find matches for the text before the cursor, up to the
                        previous bracket ( [ { < on the current line, and
                        offer matches of the entire text inside the brackets,
                        like the i( i[ i{ i< text objects.
                        This also works for tag-blocks with the it text
                        object; "<b>f|" will complete to "<b>foo bar</b>".
